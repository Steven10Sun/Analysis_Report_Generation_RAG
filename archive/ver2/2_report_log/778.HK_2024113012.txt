# Financial Analysis Report: Fortune REIT

## Company Overview

Fortune REIT operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT) listed on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, focusing primarily on the management and governance of real estate assets. The trust's operations include making strategic acquisitions and disposals while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and corporate governance standards. Managed by ESR Asset Management, a leading real estate investment manager in Asia-Pacific, Fortune REIT has established itself as a pioneering player in the Hong Kong real estate market, holding a diverse portfolio of 17 retail properties.

## Revenue Structure

Fortune REIT's portfolio comprises 17 retail properties, primarily located in Hong Kong, with a total retail space of approximately 3 million square feet and 2,793 car parking spaces. The properties include 16 private housing estate retail properties and one neighborhood mall in Singapore. In the first half of 2024, the trust reported a gross revenue of HK$871.8 million, reflecting a 4.1% decline from HK$908.7 million in the same period of 2023. This decrease was mainly attributed to negative rental reversions from real estate agencies and supermarkets, which faced increased competition and rent reductions.

## Profit

The overall decline in property income impacted net property income, which was further exacerbated by rising operating expenses, including property management fees and related costs. The cost-to-income ratio increased from 23.8% in the first half of 2023 to 25.1% in the first half of 2024, indicating that expenses have been growing at a faster rate than income. Such financial dynamics highlight the challenges faced by Fortune REIT in maintaining profitability amidst a shifting retail landscape.

## Valuation

Valuation metrics play a critical role in understanding the financial health of Fortune REIT. The capitalisation rates for properties in Hong Kong currently range from 4.0% to 4.8%, providing a benchmark for assessing the intrinsic value of the trust's real estate assets. The management's strategy of yield-accretive acquisitions and proactive portfolio management aims to enhance the net asset value of the trust while maintaining compliance with financial reporting standards.

## Summary

In summary, Fortune REIT has navigated a challenging retail environment characterized by changing consumer preferences and negative rental reversions. Despite these challenges, the trust has maintained a respectable occupancy rate of 94.8%, demonstrating its commitment to tenant retention and satisfaction. The proactive leasing strategies and efforts to diversify the tenant mix have been pivotal in sustaining occupancy levels, with a notable retention rate of 83%.

## Future Outlook

Looking ahead, Fortune REIT is poised to adapt to market changes by focusing on strategic repositioning and asset enhancement initiatives, such as the HK$300 million investment in the revitalization of +WOO. The trust's management is also exploring opportunities to expand its portfolio through targeted acquisitions that align with its long-term growth objectives. Additionally, the anticipated recovery in tourist arrivals, coupled with government initiatives to stimulate retail demand, could provide a boost to rental income in the coming periods.

## Challenges and Risks

Fortune REIT faces several challenges, including the slow recovery of tourist arrivals, changing consumption patterns, and ongoing negative rental reversions.
