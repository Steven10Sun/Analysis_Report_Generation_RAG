## Revenue Structure

The revenue structure of the company showcases a diverse portfolio, although specific details regarding revenue-generating segments were not disclosed. A significant contributor to revenue is the tobacco leaf products export business, which recorded a commendable 23% growth year-on-year. Despite challenges in the Brazil operations, where the export volume decreased despite a 43% rise in operating revenue, the overall performance indicates resilience and adaptability in a fluctuating market.

## Profit

A detailed analysis of profitability metrics reveals operational growth, although specific figures for net profit and EBITDA were not provided. The emphasis on operational strategies aimed at increasing gross profit margins is evident, especially within the Tobacco Leaf Products Export and Cigarettes Export businesses. However, external challenges, including weather conditions and shipping market fluctuations, have impacted sales volumes, leading to unmet customer needs. A shift in product structure has also resulted in increased sales of finished tobacco strips with higher unit prices but lower gross profit margins, indicating complexities in maintaining profitability.

## Valuation

Analysts primarily utilize gross profit as the valuation metric, which is derived from reportable segment revenue minus the related cost of sales. With the earnings per share (EPS) reported at HK$0.93, further analysis would be required to ascertain the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio relative to industry averages. This metric is crucial for investors seeking insights into the company's valuation against its peers and the broader market context.
