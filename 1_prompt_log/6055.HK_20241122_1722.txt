sticks, representing an increase of 68,660 thousand sticks or 41% on a year-on-year basis. The operating revenue reached 
HK$43.5 million, representing an increase of HK$9.6 million or 28% on a year-on-year basis. The gross profit reached HK$2.1 
million, representing an increase of HK$0.8 million or 57% on a year-on-year basis. The growth in results was mainly due to: (1) 
the increase in demand for orders in key markets resulting from strengthening the cultivation of key brands, exploring the 
potential for expansion of channels in key markets, and stepping up efforts in customer marketing efforts; and (2) ongoing
representing an increase of 1,299 tons or 1% on a year-on-year basis. The operating revenue reached HK$6,802.2 million, 
representing an increase of HK$354.1 million or 5% on a year-on-year basis. The gross profit reached HK$744.7 million, 
representing an increase of HK$133.3 million or 22% on a year-on-year basis. The increase in the results was mainly attributable 
to: (1) the increase in the proportion of Brazil tobacco leaf products with higher gross profit margin was recorded on a 
year-on-year basis during the Reporting Period due to the seasonal fluctuation of tobacco leaves; and (2) the overall unit sale 
price of the tobacco leaf products increased during the Reporting Period on a year-on-year basis.

Business; and (2) the continuous recovery of customer traffic in duty-free market, resulting in an increase in product sales on a

procurement prices. Such margins were determined taking into consideration factors including reasonable profit 
margin of the Company, market demand of the relevant cigarettes and services provided by the downstream 
wholesalers.
(ii) Other Duty-Free Cigarettes
The prices at which the Company procures other duty-free cigarettes categories from relevant entities under CNTC 
are determined through arm’s length negotiation, using the same pricing policies and taking into consideration the 
same factors for premium and other first tier duty-free cigarettes as described above, but the pricing for other 
duty-free cigarettes is not subject to any government-prescribed price floors.
Subsequently, similar as described above for premium and other first tier duty-free cigarettes, the Company 
determines sales prices of other duty-free cigarettes through arm’s length negotiation with customers in the
the No. 250 Notice issued in September 2017.
According to the No. 250 Notice issued by STMA, the export prices of premium cigarettes shall not be lower than 
35% of the tax-excluded allocation price of those sold domestically, while the export prices of other first tier 
duty-free cigarettes shall not be lower than 45% of the tax-excluded allocation price of those sold domestically. The 
Company’s suppliers must comply with the price floors set by STMA, which are tied to the relevant cigarette 
allocation prices that are also determined by STMA. On the basis of those price floors, the Company determines the 
ultimate procurement prices through arm’s length negotiations with relevant entities under CNTC in procuring 
premium cigarettes and first tier cigarettes for export sales. Specifically, the procurement prices generally comprise: (i) 
suppliers’ costs associated with the manufacturing of cigarettes, which include cost of raw material, utility cost, rent

corresponding market status of a particular grade; (ii) procurement costs for such tobacco leaves, including cost of 
raw material, utility cost, rent of factory premises, shipping costs, storage expenses and staff costs; and (iii) other 
factors such as seasonal demand and past procurement prices. The same pricing mechanism is adopted for purchase 
of tobacco leaves from independent third parties of the Group.

customers. The Company then solicits offer from various suppliers of tobacco leaf products by obtaining samples, price 
quotes and price floors. The Company compares the terms and samples obtained and selects the supplier that offers the 
most favourable terms for commercially viable tobacco leaf products. Based on the market condition and its own 
evaluation of the quality of the samples, the Company provides the customers with price quotes and negotiates with them 
based on the suppliers’ price floor. Our suppliers may also offer their products to us without any solicitation, and we will

a particular brand of new tobacco products; and (iv) other factors, including sales price of competitors, marketing strategies 
of the Company (such as offering competitive price to expand market presence), prevailing supply and demand in relevant 
new tobacco products market, and relationship with the relevant counterparties. New tobacco products are not subject to 
any export tariff. 
Currently, the margins utilised in the New Tobacco Products Export Business are at least 1%. Such margins were 
determined taking into consideration, among others, the relevant operating costs of the Company and the cost of 
early-stage marketing. These margins may be adjusted by the Company in response to changes in the international market 
conditions and the Company’s relevant operating costs.

decrease in sales volume was mainly due to that marketable goods were in short supply and could not fully meet customer needs. 
The increase in revenue while decrease in gross profit are mainly because there have been significant changes in product structure 
compared with the same period last year, namely, the sales volume of finished tobacco strips with higher unit sale price but lower 
gross profit level has shown a relatively significant increase in sales proportion, while sales volume of tobacco leaf by-products 
with higher gross profit level but lower unit sale price has decreased in sales proportion.

Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with Hong Kong Standard on Review Engagements 2410, Review of interim financial 
information performed by the independent auditor of the entity, issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants. A review of the interim financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial 
and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an 
audit conducted in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance 
that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly we do not express an 
audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim financial report as at 30 June
